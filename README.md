**Project-Seraphim** is an **AI reliability engineering monorepo**.  
It demonstrates how to run ML/LLM inference with production-grade guardrails:

- ✅ **SLO enforcement** for latency, availability, and error rates  
- 🔄 **Canary & rollback workflows** for safe model releases  
- 📈 **Drift detection** using embeddings and prediction distributions  
- 🔧 **Auto-scaling** on GPU/CPU usage and request throughput  
- 🧪 **Failure injection** and chaos experiments to validate resilience

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourhandle/project-seraphim.git
cd project-seraphim

# Bootstrap cluster + observability stack
make infra-apply

# Deploy inference service + monitoring
make deploy

# Run load test + watch dashboards
make load-test

👉 View Grafana dashboards at http://localhost:3000 and track SLOs in real time.
```
