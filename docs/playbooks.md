# Operational Playbooks

This section contains step-by-step operational playbooks for common scenarios in managing the Project Seraphim ML inference platform.

## Available Playbooks

- **[Rollback Procedures](playbooks/rollback.md)** - Safe model rollback strategies when issues are detected

## Playbook Structure

Each playbook follows a consistent format:

1. **Situation Assessment** - When to use this playbook
2. **Prerequisites** - Required access, tools, and preparation
3. **Step-by-Step Procedures** - Detailed execution steps
4. **Verification** - How to confirm successful completion
5. **Rollback/Recovery** - What to do if things go wrong
6. **Post-Action** - Documentation and follow-up tasks

## Contributing

When creating new playbooks:

- Use clear, numbered steps
- Include specific commands and expected outputs
- Add verification steps after each major action
- Document any prerequisites or dependencies
- Test procedures in a non-production environment first
