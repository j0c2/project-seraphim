# Welcome to Project Seraphim! 🛡️

Welcome to the documentation site for **Project Seraphim**, an AI reliability engineering platform that demonstrates how to run ML/LLM inference with production-grade guardrails.

## What is Project Seraphim?

Project Seraphim is a comprehensive platform that showcases:

- ✅ **SLO enforcement** for latency, availability, and error rates  
- 🔄 **Canary & rollback workflows** for safe model releases  
- 📈 **Drift detection** using embeddings and prediction distributions  
- 🔧 **Auto-scaling** on GPU/CPU usage and request throughput  
- 🧪 **Failure injection** and chaos experiments to validate resilience  

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/j0c2/project-seraphim.git
cd project-seraphim

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify the platform is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Architecture Overview

    GW --> |10%| TS2[TorchServe v2.0]
    GW --> Metrics[Prometheus]
    Metrics --> Grafana
    GW -.Fallback.-> Cache[Fallback Logic]
```

The platform consists of:

- **FastAPI Gateway**: Handles routing, canary logic, and fallback
- **TorchServe**: Serves ML models with versioning support  
- **Observability Stack**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- **Reliability Components**: Canary evaluation, chaos testing, drift detection
